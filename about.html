<p>At the time of this writing I am 25 years old and beginning my journey through full stack web development with the Flatiron School Online Web Dev Course. I will be maintaining this blog as a stream of conscious through the portions of this course that give me the most brain trouble. I hope this blog will be readable to the layman as well as informative to the more experienced developers whom may be reading in order to understand my thought processes. I'll be creating new entries to this blog approximately every 15 days but will be adding updates to my existing blog posts regularly. Happy readings!</p>
