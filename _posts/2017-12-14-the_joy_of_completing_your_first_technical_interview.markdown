### A Quick Write-Up for Those Who Might Need Some Words of Encouragment During These Troubling Times
I knew the fear had taken hold of me as soon as I tried to log-in to my computer. Three times I misspelled my password- cap locks engaged or double tapping a key perhaps. My fingers were trembling and I hadn't even had any coffee yet.

As the clock approached 2pm, my google searches became more and more frantic. Try as I may, no article was going to get me through what was to come.

I'm of course talking about my first technical interview since starting Flatiron. 

During this course I have completed multiple labs, debugged many issues, and built multiple projects that I was, and still am, proud of. But I have never coded *for* someone as a way to prove that I *had* learned anything. To prove that I *am* a (junior) programmer. 

Yes, the project reviews are in some ways technical interviews but there we are discussing decisions that I had spent many hours researching. We are talking about methods and APIs that we saw examples for in our lessons. This is a whole new beast.
### The Beginning
We began with normal pleasantries. My interviewer, Michael, was extremely kind and made me feel comfortable within the first minute. He explained the set-up, gave a bit of his background, and finally told me what the end goal of this process is.

This went on for the first five minutes or so and I think that he could tell how nervous I was because he loosened up the conversation by asking me to tell him about myself. After sharing our similarities about our passion for football(soccer) we decided that play time was over. It was time to get down to business.
### The Middle
We started off by discussing perhaps my weakest subject in web development: Computer Science principles. As we all know, this is not a major focus of the maintrack of the Flatiron curriculum. However, luckily I might add, I have been dabbling with the provided CS lessons available to us on Learn in between scheduling project reviews. Basically, I had learned enough in the CS lessons that I knew I knew very little CS.

His question pertained to discussing the "Big O" notation and it's implications in web development. I answered as best I could although I think I rambled a bit too long about recursive functions and callbacks. To be completely candid, I'm not even sure if that pertains to the question he asked.

I decided to end my tirade with a follow-up question: how does Big O notation affect your daily work? He seemed satisfied with my answer and duly responded to my question. Personally, I think it was a poorly worded question but he answered with poise and didn't immediately turn off his video so I know for a fact he didn't laugh at me.

He concluded this portion of the interview with a list of resources that I should check out to level-up my CS knowledge and I have a great interest in reading them.

It was now time to code.
### The End
The final portion of this interview consisted of three problems that I was tasked to solve.

The first was the palindrome test that I am sure you have seen before. This problem took me about 10 minutes to solve as he wanted me to walk through each of my decisions to describe my though process. Initally I ran into some bugs and got a bit flustered that I didnt't have access to debugger forgetting that still had access to the most popular debugger around...console.log!!

Once I started logging my results I solved the problem with only a few corrections of syntax and we were on our way.

The second problem that he threw at me was finding the longest word in a string and returning it. Luckily, this was a common question on the JS forums for interviewees so I had seen it many times. I breezed through the intialy portion using a combination of split() and sort() methods. Wham bam ala kazam!

Then came the kicker, and final problem. He then wanted me to return all of the longest words in a string including duplicates and including punction marks. I needed a moment to think this problem out but once I concluded that looping through my existing array and comparing each element to the first index (and how to express that in code) was my way forward, I was able to bumble my way to the correct answer.

### Final Thoughts
I believe that this was an extremely valuable lesson to learn before I start my true job search. I learned the overall structure of the technical interview and saw that many of the articles online describing the process are correct, albeit sometimes a bit more detailed than necessary.

My advice to anyone reading this and perhaps on the cusp of their interview would be to study hard but also to relax. The interviewers are people too and they are not computers. Suprsingly we ran into some issues that we both didn't have the answer too and I think that is emblematic of the real world. No one has the answer 100% of the time and collaboration is a big part of programming.

I believe that I have much more work to do in order to become a seriously considered candidate in the web devlopment world. On the other hand, I have to be proud of myself because, looking back at this time a year ago, the concepts that we were discussing and the solutions that I was thinking up would have seemed like complete gibberish to me. I think I can be proud of that.

Onwards!
