Have you ever considered switching your career to do something you are deeply passionate about?

If that dream career switch required you to learn a skill that you had no prior experience in, would you still do it?

In January of 2017, I asked myself these very questions and discovered that my answer to both was yes.

# A Bit of Background
I completed my B.A. Environmental Studies degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a focus on Environmental Law and Policy in June of 2014. I had already began working full time at an Industrial Hygiene firm in the Central California area by the time I walked on the graduation stage and couldn't have been more excited at the prospect of putting my education to use. However as time went by I began to feel that I was not fulfilling my potential in the position and that I had more to offer the rapidly evolving world we find ourselves in today. I wanted to produce a meaningful product for something that I was sincerely invested in and that could reach many people.

My passion is the sport of soccer. I have seen its growth in the United States as an unkown sport, rarely broadcast on national television, to it having channels specifically dedicated to broadcasting all day long. Due to my student's budget at UCSB, I could not afford a television subscription to watch my favorite teams so I had to find a solution. That solution was to access illegally broadcasted streams hosted by people all around the world faced with my same predicament. I knew this was an unsustainable fix but never considered the possibility of producing a better solution. 

That is where the Flatiron School presented me with an opportunity.

# Bringing It All Together
When asking myself the above questions, I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn new skills in order to bring the viewing capabilities of the sport of soccer to the 21st Century by working to build an internet based broadcasting platform.

This realization also brought to light the fact that I had no knowledge of computer programming whatsoever. However, as I started working through the initial free courses and doing my own outside research, I found that it is a skill that not only represents the future of all facets of our modern economy, but is also one that challenges your brain to become malleable and think in new paradigms than what we may be used to. That alone proved to me that this was a challenge that I was ready to accept in order to bring my aspirations to light.

As of the writing of this post I am 14 days into the program and have completed the Intro to Ruby, Git & GitHub, and HTML & CSS sections. I will be updating this blog periodically with my thoughts on the content, my various issues or challenges along the way, and ideas of how they might be applicable in an end product.

I hope you have enjoyed my first post and I encourage any one who reads this to ponder these very same questions if they are unsatified with their career trajectory. You might be as suprised with your own answer.

Until next time,

A.G.A.
